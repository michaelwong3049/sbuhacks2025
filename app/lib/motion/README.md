# Motion Detection Logic

## Purpose
Analyze pose data to detect musical actions (hits, strums, taps).

## Files to create:
- `motion-detector.ts` - Main motion detection engine
- `velocity-calculator.ts` - Calculate hand/wrist velocities
- `zone-detector.ts` - Detect which instrument zones are activated
- `gesture-recognizer.ts` - Recognize specific gestures (strum, hit, tap)
- `thresholds.ts` - Configurable thresholds for motion detection
